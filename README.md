# Vue Enterprise Boilerplate v3 (alpha)

This repo is currently in active development and considered in alpha release.

> This is an ever-evolving, opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue 3 + Vite SPA projects using [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue).

🎩 A huge thanks to [Chris Fritz](https://twitter.com/chrisvfritz) for the incredible work that this work builds upon. For those looking for his version, see [this branch for the original Vue 2 enterprise boilerplate](https://github.com/bencodezen/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/vue-2-version).

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
