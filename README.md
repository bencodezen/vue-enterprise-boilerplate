[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/tree/master)

> This is an ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue SPA projects using [Vue CLI 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Questions, feedback, and for now, even bikeshedding are welcome. ðŸ˜„

**:warning: This project uses Vue CLI 3, which is currently in beta so may not yet be appropriate for production projects.**

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate.git my-new-project --depth 1

# 2. Enter your newly-cloned folder
cd my-new-project

# 3. Replace this README's CI badge with a note about when you started
# and a link to a compare URL, so that you can always get an overview
# of new features added to the boilerplate since you did.
node _start.js

# 4. Delete the start script, as there can be only one beginning.
rm _start.js
```
