## `.circleci`

Configuration for continuous integration with [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/). See [the production doc](production.md#from-circle-ci) for more.

## `.vscode`

Settings and extensions specific to this project, for Visual Studio Code. See [the editors doc](editors.md#visual-studio-code) for more.

## `.vuepress`

[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) configuration for docs static site generation.

## `docs`

You found me! :wink:

## `generators`

Generator templates to speed up development. See [the development doc](development.md#generators) for more.

## `public`

Where you'll keep any static assets, to be added to the `dist` directory without processing from our build system.

### `index.html`

This one file actually _does_ get processed by our build system, allowing us to inject some information from Webpack with [EJS](http://ejs.co/), such as the title, then add our JS and CSS.

## `src`

Where we keep all our source files.

### `assets`

This project manages assets via Vue CLI. Learn more about [its asset handling here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/html-and-static-assets.html).

### `components`

Where most of the components in our app will live, including our [global base components](development.md#base-components).

### `design`

Where we keep our [design variables and tooling](tech.md#design-variables-and-tooling).

### `router`

Where the router, routes, and any routing-related components live. See [the routing doc](routing.md) for more.

### `state`

Where all our global state management lives. See [the state management doc](state.md) for more.

### `utils`

These are utility functions you may want to share between many files in your application. They will always be pure and never have side effects, meaning if you provide a function the same arguments, it will always return the same result. These should also never directly affect the DOM or interface with our Vuex state.

### `app.config.json`

Contains app-specific metadata.

### `app.vue`

The root Vue component that simply delegates to the router view. This is typically the only component to contain global CSS.

### `main.js`

The entry point to our app, were we create our Vue instance and mount it to the DOM.

## `tests`

Where all our tests go. See [the tests doc](tests.md) for more.
